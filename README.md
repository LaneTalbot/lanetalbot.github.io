Few facts of his life are known but intelligence analysts agree he was raised among the many thieves guilds of Eastern Europe before he left for the States where he likely now spends time between operations in the American Southwest.

There he is rumored to hunt and collect codices and supernatural artifacts from the period of the Mexican Inquisition. The reason for this is unknown but research continues.
